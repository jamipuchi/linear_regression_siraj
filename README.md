# Linear Regression challenge (Siraj Raval)

Response to the challenge Siraj proposed in his video: How to Make a Prediction - Intro to Deep Learning #1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOppzHpvTiQ)

The challenge was to plot a regression line of the dataset that Siraj had provided and to print the error. I printed both the standard deviation error and the mean 

Here is the plotted regression line:

The mean absolute error and standar deviation of the dataset are 0.0 and 2.99:
